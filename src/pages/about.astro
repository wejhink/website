          We build AI-native software for the real world.

          Jhink is an AI-native SaaS company. We create purpose-built products for industries where
          technology should be doing more — reducing busywork, simplifying complexity, and letting
          people focus on what they do best.

  {/* Philosophy */}
  <section class="py-20 md:py-28 bg-surface border-y border-border">
    <div class="max-w-[1200px] mx-auto px-6">
      <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-16">
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-6">Our Philosophy</h2>
          <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Most software companies are retrofitting AI onto products that were designed without it.
            We think that misses the point. When you design around AI from day one, you can rethink
            entire workflows — not just add a chatbot to an old interface.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
            AI-native means building products where intelligence is fundamental, not decorative. It
            means fewer clicks, less data entry, and more time for the work that actually matters.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-6">Why We Exist</h2>
          <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
            There are industries — healthcare, education, professional services — where the software
            tools are decades behind what's possible. The people in these fields deserve better.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
            Jhink exists to close that gap. We identify verticals where AI can have the highest
            impact and build products that professionals actually want to use.

  {/* Vision */}

        <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-6">Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Our first product, <a href="https://teja.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-accent-dark hover:underline">Teja</a>,
          is built for mental health professionals. But our vision extends far beyond a single product.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
          We're building a portfolio of AI-native tools — each one designed for a specific industry,
          each one rethinking what software in that space can be.
