We're excited to introduce Jhink.

Jhink is an AI-native SaaS company. That's a deliberate choice of words — not "AI-powered" or "AI-enhanced," but **AI-native**. Every product we build is designed from the ground up around what AI makes possible, rather than bolting intelligence onto existing software patterns.

## Why AI-Native Matters

Most software was designed in an era where every action required explicit human input. Click here, type there, navigate to this screen, fill out that form. AI gives us the opportunity to rethink these workflows entirely.

When a product is AI-native, it can:

- **Anticipate** what you need before you ask
- **Automate** the tedious parts of your work
- **Simplify** complex processes into straightforward interactions
- **Learn** from patterns to get better over time

## Our First Product: Teja

Our first product, [Teja](https://teja.app), is built for mental health professionals. Therapists and counselors spend a staggering amount of time on administrative tasks — documentation, scheduling, billing, compliance. Time that could be spent with clients.

Teja is designed to handle that burden intelligently, so practitioners can focus on the work that drew them to the profession in the first place.

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. We're building a portfolio of AI-native products, each one designed for a specific industry where technology can — and should — do more for the people it serves.

Follow along on our blog as we share what we're learning, building, and thinking about.
